# MADI PROJECT: Local Education with Emotion Recognition
## A learning assistant device designed so that the student can ask questions with their voices and receive simple explanations in real time. 
Among its main features are:
* It works without an internet connection.
* It only listens when a physical button is pressed.
* It recognizes when a student is speaking normally or with signs of frustration, adapting its tone to explain more patiently.
* It does not record personal data.
* It does not store or transmit information outside the device.
* The prototype was specifically designed to support teaching and learning processes with complete safety for students.
